# assignment-03-training-data

Insert your data in this repository.
An example is shown in folder `tina`.
Note that `tina`-folder only includes one sample file per activity. Your folder should include five each.

Your files might be very large due to high frequent sampling, resample them to 100Hz **before** uploading.
Therefore, you can use `resample.py`.
